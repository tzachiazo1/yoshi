## App configuration
### `.application.json`
Each app should contain `.application.json` in the project's root:
```
{
  "appDefinitionId": "YOUR_APP_DEFINITION_ID",
  "appName": "Your app name",
  "sentry": {
    DSN: "https://e255c968aa1143f08fc02e9243b66136@o283065.ingest.sentry.io/1510555",
    id: "SENTRY_ID",
    teamName: "some-team",
    projectName: "some-project"
  },
  "experiments": {
    "scope": "test"
  }
}
```
The content will be auto-generated by `create-yoshi-app`.
- `appDefinitionId` - App definition id of you app in app service.
- `appName` - App's name in app service.
- `sentry` - Automatically configured object according to the `team name` you've selected. `projectName` will be the same as an app's artifact name.
- `experiments`: Configuration object for current experiments scope. After generation it's mocked with `test` scope, which should be updated or removed before publishing app to production.


## Viewer and Editor Script entries
Sometimes you want to have the code common for all components. Platform provides `initAppForPage` handler for Viewer Script, which is being initialized before controllers created.
For the editor part, you can maintain the Editor Script.
There're entry-points for viewer and editor scripts allowing you to use platform methods. So we are providing `viewer.app.ts` and `editor.app.ts` concept.

To add it to the project, just create a file under `src` directory:

`touch src/viewer.app.ts` or `touch src/editor.app.ts`

### `viewer.app.ts`
Entry point for Viewer Script file.

#### `initAppForPage`
A general call to the service where it should initiate its reusable data across components.
It's called with the basic configuration of the application before the Viewer knows which components exist on the page.

Any data returned in `initAppForPage` will be passed to each controller as an `appData` value.


⚠️ You shouldn't use `createControllers`. We will generate it under the hood.

*src/viewer.app.ts*
```ts
export const initAppForPage = async (
  initParams,
  platformApis,
  wixCodeApi,
  platformServicesApis,
  flowAPI
) => {
  // Init some fake storage common for all widgets
  const kitchen = initKitchen();
  const omelette = kitchen.cook('omlette');
  
  // will be passed as an `appData.omelette` for each controller
  return {
    omelette,
  };
};
```

Returned data will be passed to all controllers.
*src/components/SomeWidget/controller.ts*
```ts
export default ({ appData }) => {
  // Do something with data received from `initAppForPage`...
  const { omelette } = appData;

  return {
    pageReady() {
      setProps({
        // Pass it to the Widget if needed
        omelette,
      });
    }
  };
};
```

For more info related to `initAppForPage` check the [Viewer platform official docs](https://bo.wix.com/wix-docs/client/client-viewer-platform/articles/lifecycle#client-viewer-platform_articles_lifecycle_initappforpage)

### `editor.app.ts`
Entry point for Editor Script file.

We are preserving the [Editor Script API](https://bo.wix.com/wix-docs/client/editor-platform/editor-application-reference/editor-platform-app), but adding `flowAPI` with useful helpers as a last argument.  
It provides already initialized `sentryMonitor` and `fedopsLogger` objects, `reportError` helper function and `getExperiments` accessor. For more info about flowAPI, please read [Component Level page](./component#flowapi)

*src/editor.app.ts*
```ts
export const editorReady = async (
  editorSDK,
  appDefinitionId,
  platformOptions,
  flowAPI
) => {
  const platform = new AppPlatform(editorSDK, appDefinitionId);

  if (platformOptions.firstInstall) {
    await platform.install();
  } else {
    await platform.hackForTemplates();
  }
};

export const getAppManifest = async () => {
  return getManifest();
};
```
